# Neighborhoods Enhancement Documentation

## Overview
Enhanced the InfoCard component and backend to support 8 starter neighborhoods instead of the original 3, improving search coverage across NYC.

## Changes Made

### Frontend Changes (`/frontend/src/Cards/InfoCard.jsx`)
- **Expanded STARTER_NEIGHBORHOODS**: Added 5 new neighborhoods to the existing array:
  - Times Square
  - Harlem
  - Williamsburg
  - Bushwick
  - Long Island City
- The StarterPrompts component automatically displays all neighborhoods as clickable buttons

### Backend Changes (`/backend/server.js`)

#### 1. Enhanced `/events` Endpoint
- **Added `limit` parameter support**: Now accepts a `limit` query parameter for returning multiple records
- **Neighborhood normalization**: Added `normalizeNeighborhood()` function to handle variations in neighborhood names
- **Improved search matching**: Uses OR conditions to match multiple neighborhood variations

#### 2. New `/neighborhoods` Debug Endpoint
- Returns top 50 neighborhoods from the database with production counts
- Useful for debugging and understanding what neighborhoods have data

#### 3. Neighborhood Mapping
The system now handles common variations and aliases:
- **Times Square**: matches "times square", "theater district", "midtown west"
- **Harlem**: matches "harlem", "central harlem", "east harlem", "spanish harlem"
- **Williamsburg**: matches "williamsburg", "williamsburg brooklyn"
- **Bushwick**: matches "bushwick", "bushwick brooklyn"
- **Long Island City**: matches "long island city", "lic", "queens", "long island city queens"
- **Midtown**: matches "midtown", "midtown manhattan", "midtown east", "midtown west"
- **Upper West Side**: matches "upper west side", "uws"
- **Greenpoint**: matches "greenpoint", "greenpoint brooklyn"

### Backend Route Updates (`/backend/routes/suggestedNeigh.js`)
- Updated the `/suggested-neighborhoods` endpoint to return all 8 neighborhoods
- This endpoint can be used by the frontend to dynamically fetch available neighborhoods

## Testing

### Manual Testing
Run the test script to verify all neighborhoods work:
```bash
cd backend
node test-neighborhoods.js
```

### API Testing
1. **Test individual neighborhood**: `GET /events?neighborhood=Times%20Square&limit=3`
2. **Check available neighborhoods**: `GET /neighborhoods`
3. **Get suggested neighborhoods**: `GET /suggested-neighborhoods`

## Usage Notes

### Frontend Integration
The InfoCard component now supports:
- 8 starter neighborhood buttons
- Dynamic neighborhood fetching from backend
- Random record selection from multiple results (when limit > 1)

### Backend Features
- **Flexible search**: Handles neighborhood name variations automatically
- **Scalable design**: Easy to add more neighborhoods and their aliases
- **Debug support**: `/neighborhoods` endpoint helps identify available data
- **Performance optimized**: Uses proper SQL indexing with LIMIT clauses

## Potential Future Enhancements
1. **Dynamic neighborhood loading**: Fetch popular neighborhoods from database on startup
2. **Fuzzy matching**: Add fuzzy string matching for user-typed neighborhood names  
3. **Borough support**: Enhance to support borough-level searches
4. **Caching**: Add Redis caching for frequently searched neighborhoods
5. **Analytics**: Track which neighborhoods are searched most frequently
